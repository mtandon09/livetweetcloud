# Live Twitter Word Cloud
This is a word cloud generator that sources live tweets with a given keyword.  The Twitter API and natural language processing are accessed via R packages, the word cloud is drawn using D3.js and packaged together as a Shiny app.

This is work in progress, but a live implementation can be found at: http://www.mayanktandon.duckdns.org/livetweetcloud/
